This project was a joint effort between two developers studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto and three artists studying the Ontario College of Art and Design as part of a Game Design course offered by both institutions such that the visuals created by the OCAD students would complement the technical knowledge provided by the U of T students. Over two months we worked together to design, prototype, playtest the game while preparing to show it off at the Level Up Showcase that year. 
<br /><br />


We aimed to create a vertical slice of an exploration game that teaches the player its mechanics and rules through gameplay rather than tutorials without significant punishment for mistakes in experimentation. We felt this leads to a more seamless gameplay experience where the player is rarely remvoed from the game, as well as encouraging more creative thinking than using a weapon to remove obstacles.
<br /><br />


As someone most interested in Game Design and the Back End Development, I focused on developing code for the behaviour of NPCs and Player abilities, where my development partner worked on the camera, environmental behaviour, and Player character movement. Please see below for images of the project that show the visuals create by the OCAD team.
<br /><br />


Since this project was built some years ago, its version of Unity is no longer supported by up-to-date web browsers, but the standalone is still available for download here:

Controller compatible and recommended, but plays just fine using keyboard and mouse using WASD for movement, and mouse for the jetpack and hologram decoy.
